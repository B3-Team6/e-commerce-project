              <p>We are Airnes ("Company," "we," "us," "our").</p>

                We operate the website http://www.airnes.com (the "Site"), as

                link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the
                "Services").
              </p>
              <p>
                These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made
                between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity
                ("you"), and Airnes, concerning your access to and use of the
                Services. You agree that by accessing the Services, you have
                read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal
                Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN
                YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU
                MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
              </p>
              <p>
                Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be
                posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly
                incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our
                sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal
                Terms from time to time. We will alert you about any changes by
                updating the "Last updated" date of these Legal Terms, and you
                waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change.
                It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal
                Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and
                will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted,
                the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of
                the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Services are intended for users who are at least 13 years of
                age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they
                reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission
                of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to
                use the Services. If you are a minor, you must have your parent
                or guardian read and agree to these Legal Terms prior to you
                using the Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                We recommend that you print a copy of these Legal Terms for your

              <p>
                The information provided when using the Services is not intended
                for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any
                jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be
                contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any
                registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
                Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services
                from other locations do so on their own initiative and are
                solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the
                extent local laws are applicable.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific
                regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
                (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA),
                etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws,
                you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services in a
                way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

                account with online accounts you have with third-party service
                providers (each such account, a "Third-Party Account") by
                either: (1) providing your Third-Party Account login information
                through the Services; or (2) allowing us to access your
                Third-Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms
                and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account.
                You represent and warrant that you are entitled to disclose your

                by the third-party service provider of the Third-Party Account.
                By granting us access to any Third-Party Accounts, you
                understand that (1) we may access, make available, and store (if
                applicable) any content that you have provided to and stored in

                it is available on and through the Services via your account,
                including without limitation any friend lists and (2) we may
                submit to and receive from your Third-Party Account additional
                information to the extent you are notified when you link your
                account with the Third-Party Account. Depending on the
                Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy
                settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts,
                personally identifiable information that you post to your
                Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your

                to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party
                service provider, then Social Network Content may no longer be
                available on and through the Services. You will have the ability
                to disable the connection between your account on the Services

                effort to review any Social Network Content for any purpose,
                including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality, or
                non-infringement, and we are not responsible for any Social
                Network Content. You acknowledge and agree that we may access
                your email address book associated with a Third-Party Account
                and your contacts list stored on your mobile device or tablet

                loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable
                attorneys’ fees and expenses, made by any third party due to or

                defense of such claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify
                you of any such claim, action, or proceeding which is subject to
                this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.

              <p>
                These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by
                us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the
                entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our
                failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
                provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent
                permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and
                obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible
                or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused
                by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or
                part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be
                unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
                provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does
                not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
                provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment
                or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of
                these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these
                Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having
                drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have
                based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack
                of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
