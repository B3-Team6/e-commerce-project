# The `pages` folder

The "pages" folder is used to organize files representing different pages or views of the web application. It plays a vital role in managing routes and providing structure to the application's user interface. Each file in the "pages" folder corresponds to a specific page and contains the necessary code or markup for that page. Proper organization of files in this folder enhances code readability and simplifies navigation within the application.

To navigate between each page, we use the routes from the `routes.js` file.

All pages have the layout (navbar & footer) thanks to the `_app.js` file.
