### i18n.js

# Description:

The `i18n.js` file initializes the i18next library for internationalization. It configures the fallback language, resources, and translations for the supported languages (English and French).

# Dependencies:

- `i18next` library
- `initReactI18next` from the `react-i18next` library

# Usage:

The `i18n.js` file exports an instance of the initialized i18next library with the following configuration:

- `fallbackLng`: The fallback language in case the requested language is not available.
- `resources`: An object containing the translations for each supported language. The translations are organized by namespaces (in this case, only the `translation` namespace is used).
- Translations: The translations are provided for different components, pages, and labels used in the application in both English and French.
