## The `BackOffice` folder

The back office is the part of an application or website that is reserved for administrators or authorized users. It provides a user-friendly and secure interface for managing and controlling the administrative aspects of a system.

The back office allows administrators to perform tasks such as user management, system settings modification, content creation or modification, report generation, and more. It is typically an area where administrators can access advanced features and management tools to oversee and control the application or website.

The back office is designed to be intuitive and easy to use so that administrators can efficiently manage system operations and data. It also provides security measures to protect sensitive information and restrict access to administrative features to authorized personnel only.
